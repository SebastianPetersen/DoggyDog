			<h2>Like owner, like dog...</h2>
			Like owner, like a dog... This saying has never been so right before.<br/>
			So many animals are looking for homes around the world, and there are a lot of different pet adoption portals out there, that require you to answer lots of questions. So much so that some people think it can be intimidating to go the adoption way.<br/>
			We want to change that, making a custom experience for each of the future Animal Parent.<br/>
			We have found out that dogs look like their owners, while cats are more similar in personality and habits to their owners.<br/>
			Just look here <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151111-why-do-dogs-look-like-their-owners">here</a><br/>
			We have created a system where it will take all of these findings into considerations when you are looking for a new family member and will ask the questions accordingly as well as create a more fun and interactive process.<br/>
			The system uses machine learning to find the best match for you.<br/>
